      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <h4>Interests:</h4>
      <p>My hobbies often revolve around being active or outdoors. I run, hike, swim, ski, and golf. Currently I'm training for the Pacific Northwest marathon this Sepember.</p>
      <p>I love exploring the PNW. A hike in Mt Hood National Forest or a trip to Bagby Hot Springs is one of my favorite ways to spend a day.</p>
      <p>My newest interest is, of course, coding. Coding is challenging in an enjoyable way. I look forward to gaining more experience and knowledge, especially in JavaScript.</p>
