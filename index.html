      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <img src="img/kennedy.jpeg" alt="picture of kennedy">
      <h4>Interests:</h4>
      <p>My hobbies often revolve around being active or outdoors. I run, hike, swim, ski, and golf. Currently I'm training for the Pacific Northwest marathon this Sepember.</p>
      <p>I love exploring the PNW. A hike in Mt Hood National Forest or a trip to Bagby Hot Springs is one of my favorite ways to spend a day.</p>
      <p>My newest interest is, of course, coding. Coding is challenging in an enjoyable way. I look forward to gaining more experience and knowledge, especially in JavaScript.</p>
      <h4>Background:</h4>
      <p>I have a Bachelors degree in Organismal Biology from the Portland State University Honor's College. Since graduating, I have worked primarily in management for Portland's local terpene company, True Terpenes.</p>
      <p>I was drawn to taking a class at Epicodus for two primary reasons. (1) I wanted to hone a new skill and keep myself in a learning and growing state of mind. (2) I recently learned a bit about coding and was intrigued by the creativity and complexities that were involved in bringing a website to life.</p>
